    title: 'Software Engineer',
    description: 'I hold a degree in Systems Analysis (from FIUBA) with over 6 years of experience as a software engineer, currently able to contribute my knowledge and experience as a Team Lead. I enjoy the constant challenge of learning and improving, finding motivation at every stage of the process, from the initial idea to the implementation. I have a full-stack profile with a strong focus on technology, with experience in both infrastructure and development, covering both server-side and client-side. This gives me an additional advantage, allowing me to contribute to the team on both fronts. I consider myself a highly committed individual, capable of working effectively in teams and providing innovative solutions to business challenges. At the same time, I place a strong emphasis on results, as ultimately, they determine the success of the product.'
